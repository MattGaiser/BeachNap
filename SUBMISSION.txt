Why "BeachNap"?

The name is inspired by Slack—but asks the question: why are you only slacking and not napping?

The answer: poor communication habits. Repetitive questions interrupt your flow. Vague "hi" or "hello" messages demand your attention without providing any useful information. You're constantly context-switching instead of relaxing.

BeachNap fixes this in two ways:

1. Never get bothered by answered questions — Our AI surfaces answers from your team's chat history before the question is even sent. If it's been answered before, you're never interrupted at all.

2. No more meaningless messages — The Tone Check feature blocks incomplete messages like "hi", "hey", or "quick question?" that distract you but provide zero context. Every message that reaches you is actionable.

================================================================================

Try It Out

Knowledge Check — Type these questions in the #engineering channel to see AI-synthesized answers:
- How do I deploy?
- What database are we using?
- How long do auth tokens last?

Tone Check — Try typing these incomplete messages to see the blocking warning:
- hi
- hey
- quick question
- ping

The Clone & Twist

Cloned App:   Slack
AI Twist:     "Preflight" knowledge synthesis - get answers from your team's chat history before you even send your question

================================================================================

How It Works

1. Type a question in any channel
2. AI detects it's a question (hybrid regex + DeepSeek classification)
3. Vector search finds relevant conversations from your team's history
4. Knowledge synthesis combines fragmented messages into a clear answer
5. See the answer in a "Knowledge Found" card before sending

No more asking "has anyone solved this before?" and waiting hours for a response.

AskCodi Integration

BeachNap uses AskCodi's DeepSeek model (deepseek-chat) for two core AI features:

1. Smart Question Detection

// Hybrid approach: regex for obvious cases, AI for ambiguous ones
const completion = await askcodi.chat.completions.create({
  model: "deepseek-chat",
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "Classify if this is a question..." }],
  max_tokens: 5,
  temperature: 0,
});

2. Knowledge Synthesis

// Combines conversation fragments into coherent answers
const completion = await askcodi.chat.completions.create({
  model: "deepseek-chat",
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a knowledge synthesizer..." }],
  max_tokens: 300,
  temperature: 0.3,
});

Why this matters: Instead of just returning raw search results, BeachNap synthesizes answers that combine information from multiple conversations, note who said what, and highlight when knowledge evolved over time.
